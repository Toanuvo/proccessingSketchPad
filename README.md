# proccessingSketchPad
 
A sketch pad created using the Processing java library. Allows modelling of graphs. You can add and delete edges and vertices, create parellel and loop edges, and create digraphs. You can also perform algothims on graphs such as dijkstras, spanning trees, and bipartiteness. The program will also display graph matrix information.
